### From my website (lukepeterson.co.uk):

In the following example the red rectangle represents a potential viewbox for an SVG. Everything inside the rectangle is what can be seen by the user.

A viewbox positioned like the one above, would cut off part of the graphic.

Instead, the viewbox should be positioned to fit the content of the SVG, so that the whole graphic can be seen, while also not leaving too much white-space.

This gives the correct final image.
